    "In this week's laboratory we are going to shift, scale and combine images. Doing this is critical to produce combined images where the signal-to-noise is improved, poor quality data is rejected and object fluxes (measured in ADU) that can then be tied to calibrated magnitudes. \n",

    "\n",
    "You are expected to read the lab notebook prior to the lab, and the Prelab Questions are designed to prompt you to consider what you have read. This will hopefully prepare you for the lab session and ultimately save time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 1: Why do we subtract the background before combining images?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 2: Why is it often better to take 10 exposures of a science object and combine them instead of taking a single longer exposure?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 3: What is an advantage of a median combine over a mean combine?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 4: The traditional centroid is a flux weighted mean of the x-y pixels positions. Using online resources, find out what the astropy centroid_2dg function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 5: Why is it important to visually inspect images with ds9? What sort of errors could visual inspection catch that may be missed by statistics calculated automatically? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quation 6: We will be using for loops quite often in this notebook.  Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a loop and just a single print statement:\n",
    "p <br>\n",
    "py <br>\n",

    ">Q1 - Because we have a reference for our background only valid for single science images, not combined science images.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Q2 - Because it's easier to take 10 separate exposures - the observation is less prone to disturbances like knocking/human error. If a 10 minute exposure is ruined, that's 10 minutes wasted and we need to take another 10 minute exposure. But if one of the 1 minute exposures is ruined throughout the course of taking 10 1 minute exposures, we can discard that exposure, waste 1 minute, and take another exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    ">This also transfers over to analysis after the fact - if you get back to the lab and discover that one of your 10 minute exposures has been ruined somehow, you can't discard 3 minutes' worth of that exposure and continue to analyse the data. If you have separate 1 minute exposures, you can still perform analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Similarly, it ensures that all your data isn't ruined by anomalous events - like in Q3.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Q3 - A median combine is less prone to outliers. For example, in outside of visual wavelength observations, a streak of few pixels can be completely saturated by a cosmic ray of some sort. A median combine will discard the outlier pixels if those appear only in one exposure, whereas a mean will factor those in to produce a skewed combine.\n",
    "\n",
    ">At a less extreme scale, this logic also applies for pixels that have been disproportionately saturated by Gaussian noise purely as a result of probability.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Q4 - Calculate the centroid of a 2D array by fitting a 2D Gaussian (plus a constant) to the array - per the photutils documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Q5 - Some large-scale qualitative human error like a telescope being knocked generating a junk image, or perhaps more subtly and likely - something like a dark exposure being marked as a science exposure due to a mistake in naming conventions or metadata assignment.\n"
