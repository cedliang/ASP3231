    "The observation for the dust donut picture also matches what we would expect - the median is decreased compared to the plain subregion since less counts are being detected due to the shadow, and the presence of both obstructed components and unobstructed components (by virtue of being a ring) causes the standard deviation to be higher. Lower minimum, lower mean, higher standard deviation due to heterogeneity - it's about on par with what we expect.\n",

This is a portion of the image where the ccd is either distorted, or physically obstructed by the shadow of the edge of the filter. We can see this manifest in the significantly lower minimum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree to which the presence of this vignetting increases the standard deviation from the mean seems to heavily outweight any benefit we get from observing more pixels, and this is to be expected. Clearly, a large number of very low counts in a select region of the image will cause the square root of the sum of the squares of the difference from the mean by definition to increase substantially.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we notice that the medians for both the dust donut and the whole image cases aren't as impacted as the means when comparing with the region without structures. This is to be expected - medians are worse when it comes to handling data that have highly disjoint/discontinuous distribution characteristics, but are better at eradicating substantial but continuous and non-overwhelming outliers like this."

    "We can clearly see the effect that increasing initial mass has on the star's lifespan, as we begin to see stars that have already traversed onto the giant branches. The point at the tip of the asymptotic branch is from a star with initial mass M = 3.49848485 msol, and the very next data point is the traversal of the post-AGB stage all the way across to the single data point with magnitude of beyond -5, which resulted from a star with initial mass M = 3.49848580 msol. \n",

    "The sparsity of the data points in this post-AGB region indicates the extreme brevity of this stage of the star's life - even though the isochrone simulation is reducing the step size of M_init in this region substantially in an attempt to provide us with more data!"
